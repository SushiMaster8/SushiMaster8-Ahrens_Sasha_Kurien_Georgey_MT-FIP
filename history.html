					<p>In 1786 a young John Molson at the ripe age of 18 sailed to Canada from England to open a brewery. He succeeded, founding the Molson brewery, the oldest brewery in North America and the second oldest company in Canada. In 1903 they created their first "Molson Export" brew, this was a refreshing golden ale with a rich taste.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="history2">
					<p>In 1950 Molson made the decision to install a clock to the side of their Montreal factory. This was Quebec's largest functioning clock and was visible from up to 12 km away. This became a signature piece of their modern logo. A few years later in 1957, they co-purchased the Canadian Arena and in part, some of the Montreal Canadians, a staple of the Quebec community.</p>

					<p>In 1959 Molson Canadian finally arrived in canadian markets. This was a clear crisp brew that took advice from the customers to create a beer for the people. A decade later Molson partnered with the other hockey titan in Canada, the Toronto Maple Leafs. This partnership is still going today, for over 40 years strong. </p>
				</div>

				<p class="closer">Molson Canadian is still a dominant brand today, a staple in the Canadian beer market. The brand is iconic for "I am Canadian" advertisments, Red beer fridges, and their large clock in Quebec, all staples of the titan of industry which originated from a young man with a dream.</p>
